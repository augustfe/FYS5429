We develop a framework in order to simplify the implementation of extended physics-informed neural networks (XPINNs).
The proposed implementation aims to simplify the process of setting up an XPINN, through automating the domain decomposition and initial set up of the networks.
This allows the user to focus on the problem specific details of a given issue, rather than the underlying details of how everything is calculated and communicated.
With this, we were able to utilize XPINNs for solving a number of different partial differential equations (PDEs) without having to worry about errors in the underlying network.
We compared our results on the advection, Poisson and Navier-Stokes equations with that of a singular physics-informed neural network (PINN), getting worse, but comparable, results.
As XPINNs decompose the domain, each sub-PINN is trained on a portion of the total points available, and without implementing parallelization, we were not able to increase the number of points without also increasing the total computational time.
