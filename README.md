# FYS5429
## Advanced machine learning and data analysis for the physical sciences

This repository contains project work for the course for the spring semester of 2024. The course is primarily project driven, with a great deal of flexibility in the choice of project. For the first one, we've decided to explore XPINNs, and how one might implement it with a focus on modularity and performance. 

### Course content
- Advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning methods provide tools that have broad applicability in scientific research. These techniques are being applied across the diversity of research topics in modern science, leading to advances that will facilitate scientific discoveries and societal applications.
- This course focuses on advanced machine learning and statistical learning methods applied to a broad variety of problems in the physical sciences and life science, from computational neuroscience to the analysis of high-energy physics experiments. Supervised and unsupervised learning methods are discussed, spanning from various deep learning methods to Bayesian modeling.
