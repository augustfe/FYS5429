## Introduction
Project2TSP is a project that aims to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and other combinatorial problems using GCNs. The TSP is a classic optimization problem in computer science, where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city.

## Installation
To use this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install .
```

## Usage
The repo contains the Graph Convolution network utilized in the project, alongside a number of utility functions.
The results presented in the project were generated with `main_hamiltonian_cycle.ipynb` and `main_vertex_cover.ipynb`.
