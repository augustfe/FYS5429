This paper utilized Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in order to solve combinatorial graph problems.
This is done physics-informing them, exploiting the deep connection between Ising glass models and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization.
This allows the models performance to be measured by a differentiable function, which doubles as the loss function of the network.
This framework is able to outperform a simple approximate algorithm for the Minimum Vertex Covering (MVC) problem, however struggles with the more complex Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
